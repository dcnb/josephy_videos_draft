        <h2>About {{ site.data.theme.fancy-title }}</h2>

        <p>Idaho <sup>Queered</sup> is an oral history project to collect, digitize, and archive oral histories from members of the LGBTQ community across Idaho who are willing to speak about their experience.
        These oral histories will be made publicly available via the Idaho <sup>Queered</sup> website over the course of the next two years with the goal of representing LGBTQ voices from all forty-four counties of Idaho.</p>

        <p>The project was originally inspired by Denise Bennett collecting oral histories to make the documentary film <em>Gotts Point</em>, about the 2016 death of UI alumnus and former employee Steven Nelson. 
        Nelson was robbed and beaten to death in Nampa, Idaho in what federal prosecutors determined was a hate crime.</p>

        <p>"We want to get a contemporary and diverse history represented. The goal is to document histories in every county of Idaho. It’s history. I want to document history. It’s just getting the word out and convincing people their life is interesting enough to tell."</p>

        <p>Idaho <sup>Queered</sup> is supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Pride Foundation, the Idaho Women's Giving Circle, the Latah County Community Foundation, the Idaho Humanities Council, and many generous individual donors.</p>
